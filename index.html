          <p> Luna Siedlecki is a student at Lethbridge Polytechnic taking their Multimedia Production course. They're
            only in
            their first year, but they're excited to be here and doing something new in their life. So far their
            favourite
            class would either be Scripting or Research &amp; Writing, as they both tie into some wild childhood dream
            of
            becoming a video game developer or a writer. Even Luna is a little unsure why they've wanted such a thing
            for such
            a long time, but they can assume that the horror genre had something to do with it. Outside of school
            they're also
            part time at McDonald's <i>- the most exciting fast food place! -</i> and up for a manager position after
            nearly
            three years of working there.

          <p> They aren't the most confident in themselves, but there are a few times where they can show off a strange
            fun
            fact or two. Such as when they were younger they were able to be on the front page for their Ukrainian dance
            group, Troyanda. Or that in grade 8 or 9 <i>(even Luna can't fully remember)</i> they got gold in a dance
            competition that took place in Calgary, and their school announced it over the intercom in the morning.
            They've
            had a bunch of people in their life call them kind, loving, and selfless. </p>

          <p> Meanwhile, outside of work and school they're a very creative person, as they love anything art related.
            They
            have a strong passion for dance and singing, loving such things for as long as they can remember, which
            could've
            been influenced by both of their parents. Their dad, Patrick, used to be the main voice for the CJOC radio
            station
            <i>- along with singing everything in our Ukrainian orthodox, including the priest himself! -</i> whilst
            their mom
            Nicole was very encouraging of the things that they loved, helping them to improve how they sounded while
            singing
            growing up.

          <p> They're a big video game nerd, loving the previously mentioned horror genre, with their favourite current
            games
            being <b><a href="https://fearandhunger.wiki.gg/wiki/%22Fear_and_Hunger:_the_Tormentpedia%22_Wiki" target="_blank">Fear and Hunger</a>, <a href="https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_Wiki" target="_blank">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>, and  <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda.</a></b> For the record, Luna does
            know The
            Legend of Zelda isn't a part of that horror genre, and is indeed in the adventure one, but it is a game that
            they
            very much enjoy and are passionate about. They do still feel bad for when they were little and accidentally
            broke
            their younger brother, Nikolas', Nintendo 3DS. Even though Luna swears to him that they don't, indeed,
            remember a
            single thing about that, their brother says that he'll never forgive them for somehow stepping on and
            breaking
            such a precious piece of childhood. Even though he got a new one anyways at some point, it's still something
            that
            gets brought up from time to time. </p>
