    <img src="Images/Resized_Leiko.jpg" alt="The Girly Pop :3">

    <p> Everyone calls me fun, friendly, and bubbly! I'm 18 and from Japan, going to the prestigious school *Hope's Peak Academy! Yay! And I'm the Ultimate Chemist, it took a <i> loonnggg </i> time to get there, but I'm happy I did! A couple of my classmates thanked me for helping them out, but it's nothing! I like doing that for my friends!! My friends are like my family, and... and my actual family I don't really... talk to anymore. But I do wish for the best for them. I'm happy how I am now, though! I feel like myself, being a girl now, and I have so many cool friends and my partners! So don't worry about me!
